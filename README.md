Travelers Case Competition(2017 finalist): A Predictive Retention Model Solution

Business Problem: An insurance company is concerned about the company's retention rates as well as key drivers that cause policy cancellations.

Our Solution: Developed a predictive model to identify whether policies will be cancelled before the end of term as well as provided recommendations based on variables that are most influential in causing policy cancellation.
